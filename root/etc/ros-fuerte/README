This directory contains the ROS configuration for your robot.

By default the /etc/ros-distro directory is symlinked to /etc/ros,
if you want to prevent changes from being overwritten when updates
are released, remove the symlink and copy /etc/ros-fuerte to /etc/ros.

Files and their uses are listed below:

/etc/ros/network.conf

 * The network configuration can be specified here if
   auto-configuration fails.

/etc/ros/setup.*

 * Sets up the ROS environment for various shells.

/etc/ros/robot.launch

 * This launch file starts the PR2 from scratch.  The launch file is
   just an inclusion of the default launch files, but if you have
   changes to your robot (e.g. removing and arm or adding a sensor),
   this is the place to put those, and this can be treated like a
   configuration file.  This file typically references
   /etc/ros/urdf/robot.xml

/etc/ros/urdf/

 * This directory contains calibrated and uncalibrated
   fuerte-specific URDFs.  /etc/ros/urdf/robot.xml
   is loaded by default from robot.launch.
